# QuantC
Localized quantification tool with the goal of becoming a product similar to BigQuant, JoinQuant. The underlying data from [巨潮资讯(cninfo)](http://webapi.cninfo.com.cn/).<br>
The data provided by cninfo is more comprehensive, but an account can only call interface 1000 times for free. It is still not
clear the price of call once. I guess it should not very expensive. So I decided to use it and make a simple file cache function to reduce call times.<br>
Quantc many designs refer to BigQuant, simple and straightforward, now, it's still has few features, but I will continue to improve it.

## Requirement
Python version >= 3.0

highcharts
