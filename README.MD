# cninfo-sdk
Packaging stock data api provided by [巨潮资讯(cninfo)](http://webapi.cninfo.com.cn/).
I always wanted to make something on the quantitative analysis, but I have not found any good stock data service for free use,
then I found cninfo.
The data provided by cninfo is more comprehensive, but an account can only call interface 1000 times for free. It is still not
clear the price of call once. I guess it should not very expensive. So I decided to use it.
Maybe I should make a database to cache some data to reduce call times.

## Requirement
